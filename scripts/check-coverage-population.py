"""Ask the collector what it measured, and compare it with a declared population.

`--cov-fail-under` is a lower bound, and a lower bound is not a detector on its
own: shrink the denominator and the percentage goes up. This script is what
earns the floor the right to be a lower bound. It reads the JSON report
coverage.py wrote — the population the collector actually produced — and
compares it, as a set, against an independent walk of this checkout.

Three things about how it does that are deliberate.

**Two sides, two implementations.** One side is the report; the other is the
walk below, with its predicates written out. Reading the report twice — counting
its entries, or filtering it for test paths — is not a second implementation: a
module missing from the report is missing from the filtered copy too, so both
sides lose it in the same step. That is detector rule 5.

**Sets, not counts.** A count cannot catch a deletion, and a hand-maintained
count teaches everyone to update it rather than to look at it.

**It fails in both directions.** A check built from the report alone holds only
the direction where something *enters* the population. Measured in the sibling `media_import` repository, where both vectors exist:

    a production module leaves, dropped by a coverage `omit` entry
        -> 88.83% against a floor of 80.50, every step green, and the module
           count printed in the log fell from 14 to 13, asserted by nothing
    a production module never arrives, because its directory has no
    `__init__.py`
        -> 80.5045%, identical to four decimals, because coverage.py does not
           walk such a directory at all

Both are failures here. The second is why the walk does not require an
`__init__.py`: replicating coverage.py's own rule would reproduce its blind spot
on the side that is supposed to catch it.

This file is duplicated in the sibling addon repositories, like `frontmatter.py`
and `credentials.py`, because they are separate repositories that cannot share
code. Keeping them in step is a PR-review duty.
