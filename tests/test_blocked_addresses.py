"""Knowledge's half of the SSRF address contract.

The rule "which IP addresses may a clip fetch reach" is implemented twice:
``app.services.fetcher._is_blocked_ip`` here, and ``_is_blocked_ip`` in
``backend/app/services/safe_image_fetch.py`` in the Litloft repository, which
runs in its own container and cannot import this one. The core half of this
file is ``backend/tests/test_ssrf_blocked_addresses.py`` there.

**The two tables below are declared answers, not a comparison.** Checking one
implementation against the other is green whenever both are wrong the same way,
which is the likely drift: the second copy was written by reading the first.
Each side is checked against the literal instead.

What this cannot hold: nothing mechanically compares the two copies of the
table. This repository's ``Dockerfile.test`` has this repository as its build
context and core does not run these tests. The count and the two category
assertions below catch rows that go missing from *this* copy; rows deleted from
both copies at once are not reachable from any test in either repository.
