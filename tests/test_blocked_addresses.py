"""Knowledge's half of the SSRF address contract.

The rule "which IP addresses may a clip fetch reach" is implemented twice:
``app.services.fetcher._is_blocked_ip`` here, and
``app/services/safe_image_fetch._is_blocked_ip`` in core, which runs in its own
container and cannot import this one. The core half of this file is
``backend/tests/test_ssrf_blocked_addresses.py`` in the Litloft repository.

**The two tables below are declared answers, not a comparison.** Checking one
implementation against the other is green whenever both are wrong the same way,
which is the likely drift: the second copy was written by reading the first.
Each side is checked against the literal instead.

What this cannot hold: nothing mechanically compares the two copies of the
table. This repository's ``Dockerfile.test`` has this repository as its build
context and core does not run these tests. The exact-count assertions below
catch a row that goes missing from *this* copy; a row deleted from both copies
at once is not reachable from any test in either repository.
